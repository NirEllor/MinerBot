🤖 Automated Web3 Mining for Research

MiningBot acts as a Web3 testnet miner —
including automated reward collection, wallet cycling, and multi-worker orchestration —
to recreate the full experience of Sepolia-style testnet liquidity generation for research environments.

It is designed for developers and researchers who need a realistic mining-like automation framework
to test distributed wallet management, automation pipelines, and blockchain-based systems.

Originally developed as part of the Data MarketPlace Research Lab
at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

## ⚙️ Features

- ⚡ **Parallel mining** – concurrent faucet requests with async or Docker workers
- 🔐 **Secure wallet handling** – environment-based private-key management
- 🌐 **RPC integration** –  works with **Infura**, **Alchemy**, or any custom endpoint
- 🧠 **Smart scheduling** – timed requests to prevent faucet bans
- 🪄 **Automated fund redistribution** – balances wallets dynamically for experiments
- 🧰 **Docker-ready** deployment
